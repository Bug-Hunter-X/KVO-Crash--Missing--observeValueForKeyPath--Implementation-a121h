This code attempts to use KVO (Key-Value Observing) with a custom class that doesn't properly implement the necessary methods.  Specifically, it lacks the `-observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:` method required to handle KVO notifications. This will lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.
