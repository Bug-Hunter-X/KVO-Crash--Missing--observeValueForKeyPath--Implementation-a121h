This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C error related to Key-Value Observing (KVO). The `BuggyKVO.m` file showcases code that crashes because it doesn't implement the necessary `-observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:` method. The `FixedKVO.m` file provides a corrected version that properly handles KVO notifications, preventing the crash.  This is a critical error because it can lead to unexpected application termination.
